    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <h4>Stir Fry</h4>

            <ul>
                <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
                <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons oil of your choice</li>
                <li>1/2 small head cabbage</li>
                <li>1 medium onion</li>
                <li>1 bell pepper</li>
                <li>4 ounces Baby Bella mushrooms</li>
            </ul>

        <h4>Sauce</h4>

            <ul>
                <li>2 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons plus 1/4 cup lower-sodium soy sauce</li>
                <li>3/4 cup of beef broth</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon sesame oil</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons freshly grated ginger</li>
                <li>sesame seeds and sliced green onion</li>
            </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    Heat a wok or large skillet over medium-high heat. Add ground beef,
                    and cook until browned and no longer pink, breaking up clumps with
                    a wooden spoon, about 5 minutes. Stir in garlic, and cook until
                    fragrant, about 30 seconds. Drain fat, transfer to a plate, and set aside.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Heat oil in the same pot, and add cabbage, onion, bell pepper, and mushrooms.
                    Stir and cook until veggies are crisp tender, about 5 to 7 minutes.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Meanwhile, whisk cornstarch and 2 tablespoons soy sauce in a small bowl to make
                    a smooth paste. Whisk in beef broth, 1/4 cup soy sauce, sesame oil, and ginger
                    until well combined.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Return cooked beef to the wok and combine with the veggies. Pour in sauce, and stir
                    until everything is evenly coated. Cook, stirring constantly, just until sauce thickens
                    and reduces slightly. 
                </li>

                <li>
                    Sprinkle with sesame seeds and green onion, and serve over rice or noodles.
                </li>


            </ol>
